## Running Instruction: 
*precondition: You need to install jupyter notebook to run the code file (can not run in python environment directly).*
1. open .ipynb file in jupyter notebook
2. run all codes following picture instructionï¼š

4. Result analysis: For 'Pineapple' and 'Mango' / Grape White' and 'Grape Pink', the SVM model can 100% detect/classify them. While the result for 'Potato Red' and 'Potato Sweet' is only 78.67%.


5. For more binary fruit detection, you can just add a cell and input like this:
   fruitlist=['fruit1','fruit']
   Fruit_Dectetion(fruitlist)
   fruit1 and fruit2 are two kinds of fruit that you wanna to detect/classify.
